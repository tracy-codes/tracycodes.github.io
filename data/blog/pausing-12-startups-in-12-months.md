![Putting a pause on 12 startups in 12 months](https://og.tracycodes.com/**Hitting%20pause**.png?theme=dark&md=1&fontSize=100px)

I'd like to keep an open and honest log of what's been going on.

On June 1st, 2021 I committed to building 12 startups in 12 months. Since then, I built about 3/4 of a product that will allow remote teams to make assigning partners on teams a lot easier to manage.

Between June 1st and now, I also got an offer to work on a pretty crazy project with an ambitious timeline. Because of this, I've had to hit pause on working on any side projects until we go live.

I can't really say much about the project right now, but I should be able to do some writeups about it once we're out of "stealth-mode".

Until then, I have a few other blogs in progress that are more about life, career movement, and so on. Hope you look forward to reading those.
