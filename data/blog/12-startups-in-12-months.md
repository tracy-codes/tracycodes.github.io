![12 Startups in 12 Months](https://og.tracycodes.com/**F*ck%20it.%20Just%20Build%20%2B%20Ship.**.png?theme=dark&md=1&fontSize=100px)

After reading pretty much all of [@levelsio's](https://twitter.com/levelsio) [blog posts](https://levels.io/) around [startups, building, shipping](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), and the [Open Startup initiative](https://nomadlist.com/open), I'm publicly challenging myself to building 12 startups in 12 months to see what the I can come up with.

## Why the f\*ck would you do that to yourself?

### 1. Boredom & desire

Honestly, because I'm bored outside of my day-job right now. I also became obsessed with reading about Pieter's successes, failures, and opinions through his blog and twitter.

Along with that, I am already a software engineer and have most of the skills and knowledge to build startups on my own. Whether they're actually successful or not is the real question.

I also have a desire to just make more money and live a more free lifestyle. This includes being able to go on trips/travel more (COVID-19 lockdown gave me huge travel FOMO), not having to worry about saving for retirement, and being able to retire at a resonably young age instead of in my 60s [like the average US population](https://www.yahoo.com/now/average-retirement-age-every-state-150000464.html).

### 2. Finishing projects

You may resonate with this point. I have a hard time finishing projects when there isn't a real motivator behind it. Obviously anything with my day-job gets done because I have a responsibility to get that work done for a fixed-rate of pay. What I'm talking about here is starting side projects and abandoning them either out of pure laziness, lack of motivation, or _some other excuse_.

### 3. Being more original

One thing I really resonate and agree with from [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio) is to just be more original. This means doing things outside of your own bubble, experiencing new things, etc. just for the sake of being more original.

Lately I've felt stuck, in a rut with life outside of work and that doesn't feel right to me. I need something to do, to focus on.

While it seems like I'm being unoriginal by doing the same thing someone else has done, not a lot of people are openly building startups. A lot of people are _talking_ about building startups, but not a lot of people are actually doing the _building_ part in the open. I'm pretty sure I can count on my fingers and toes the number of prominent people building startups in public.

## My Process

I use the following tools for my day-to-day knowledge & project management:

1. [Notion](https://notion.so) - Long term knowldgebase and project info
2. [Linear](https://linear.app) - Short-term projects and task management

I'm going to keep [this notion board](https://www.notion.so/f92dc5fc00f54baa820e7f8a3e0d04a5?v=89055f7fa0a04674bc73e682d444a7ac) up to date with new ideas and what's in progress. _Hopefully_ I'll only have 1 project in progress at once. I want to keep from burning myself out, but I also wnat to get shit done.

## Progress

I'll update my progress here with each month's startup. I may do some streaming over at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tracycodes) if I'm feeling up for it. Follow me there and on Twitter [@tracy_codes](https://twitter.com/tracy_codes) for updates.

Currently nothing's been done. Check back in July, 2021 for an update here.
